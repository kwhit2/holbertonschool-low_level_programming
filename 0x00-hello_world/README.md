- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function

## Task Descriptions:

- 0 - Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE, and the output is saved in the file C
- 1 - Script that compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c
- 2 - Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file. The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file is named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c
- 3 - Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE
- 4 - C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle followed by a new line. Uses function puts.
- 5 - C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art, uses function printf
- 6 - C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- 8 - Script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file with extension .s. The C file name is saved in the variable $CFILE
- 9 - C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error. Does not use puts or printf. Returns 1.
