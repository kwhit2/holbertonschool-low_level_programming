# 0x1A-hash_tables

## Learning Objectives:

- What is a hash function
- What makes a good hash function
- What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
- What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
- What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Task Descriptions:

- 0-hash_table_create.c - function that creates a hash table. Returns a pointer to the newly created hash table, or if something went wrong, returns NULL
- 1-djb2.c - hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm.
- 2-key_index.c - function that gives you the index of a key. Uses the hash_djb2 function. Returns the index at which the key/value pair should be stored in the array of the hash table
- 3-hash_table_set.c - function that adds an element to the hash table. Returns: 1 if it succeeded, 0 otherwise. In case of collision, a new node is added at the beginning of the list
- 4-hash_table_get.c - function that retrieves a value associated with a key. Returns the value associated with the element, or NULL if key couldnâ€™t be found
- 5-hash_table_print.c - function that prints a hash table.
- 6-hash_table_delete.c - function that deletes a hash table.
- 100-sorted_hash_table.c - rewriting of the previous functions using given data structures.
hash_tables.h - header file containing all libraries and function prototypes.
